Each API call is validated via the authentication header.\n\nThe following Information is used as credentials to access SMS API for your Application in the HTTP basic authentication header in the API call request\n\n- **Application ID** or **APP_ID** as _Username_\n    \n- **Application Key** or **APP_KEY** as _Password_\n    \n\n<img src=\"https://content.pstmn.io/2e206c5e-c6b5-43c7-9585-0aaf4d970e68/aW1hZ2UucG5n\" width=\"978\" height=\"170\">\n\nThe Authorization header in the above example contains a value XXXXX which is a base64 encoded string of the APP_ID:APP_KEY.\n\n### How to get APP_ID & APP_KEY\n\nAll API Credentials are paired to a Project. You will need to create a Project first to receive the API credentials. To create Project, follow the given steps:\n\n- Login to [EnableX Portal](https://portal.enablex.io)\n    \n- **Navigate**: {Main Menu} Projects / My Projects\n    \n- **Click**: Project Name – to reach Project Dashboard.
